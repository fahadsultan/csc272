    "There are too many data modalities to eumerate an exhaustive list. Each data modality has its own unique characteristics and often require specialized methods to process and analyze. Study and analysis of many data modalities is an area of research within itself. For example, Computer Vision is the area of research that deals with images and videos. Speech processing is the area of research that deals with sounds. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the area of research that deals with text.\n",

    "1. **Text**: Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics\n",
    "2. **Images**: Computer Vision, Digital Image Processing\n",
    "3. **Sounds**: Digital Signal Processing (DSP)\n",
    "4. **Graphs**: Graph Theory, Network Theory\n",
    "5. **Time Series**: Time Series Analysis\n",
    "6. **Geographic**: Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Spatial Computing."
