    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "Most everyday mathematics consists of manipulating numbers one at a time. Formally, we call these values **scalars**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the temperature in Greenville is a balmy $72$ degrees Fahrenheit. If you wanted to convert the temperature to Celsius you would evaluate the expression $c = \\frac{5}{9}(f - 32)$, setting $f = 72$. In this equation, the values $5$, $9$, and $32$ are _constant scalars_. The variables $c$ and $f$ in general represent _unknown scalars_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote scalars by ordinary lower-cased letters (e.g. $x$, $y$, and $z$) and the space of all (continuous) _real-valued_ scalars by $\\mathbb{R}$. The expression $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a formal way to say that $x$ is a real-valued scalar. The symbol $\\in$ (pronounced “in”) denotes membership in a set. For example, $x, y \\in {0, 1}$ indicates that $x$ and $y$ are variables that can only take on values of $0$ or $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalars in Python are represented by numeric types such as `int` and `float`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "y = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"x+y:\", x+y, \"x-y:\", x-y, \"x*y:\", x*y, \"x/y:\", x/y, \"x**y:\", x**y)\n",

    "## Vectorized Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector based programming (also known as array based programming) is a programming paradigm that uses operations on arrays to execute tasks. This is in contrast to scalar based programming where operations are performed on individual elements of an array.\n",

    "Vectorization operates at the level of individual instructions sent to a processor within each node. For instance, in the illustration shown here, the instruction is to add 5 to a column of numbers and copy the results to a new column B. With vectorization, all the data elements in that column are transformed simultaneously, i.e. the instruction to add 5 is applied to multiple pieces of data at the same time. This paradigm is sometimes referred to as Single Instruction Multiple Data (or SIMD).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of vectorization as subdividing the work into smaller chunks that can be handled independently by different computational units at the same time.\n",

    "With vectorization, performing the same operation on a modern intel CPU is 16 times faster than the sequential mode. The performance gains on GPUs with thousands of computational cores is even greater. However, despite these remarkable performance benefits, most analytical code out there is written in the slower sequential mode. This is not a surprise, since until about a decade ago, CPU and GPU hardware could not really support vectorization for data analysis. So most implementations had to be sequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last 10 years, however, have seen the rise of new technologies like CUDA from NVidia and advanced vector extensions from Intel that have dramatically shifted our ability to apply vectorization. Because of the power of vectorization, some traditional vendors now make claims about including vectorization in their offerings. But shifting to this new vectorized paradigm is not easy, since all of your code needs to be written from scratch to utilize these capabilities. \n",

    "Vectorization can only be applied in situations when operations at individual elements are independent of each other. For example, if we want to add two arrays, we can do so by adding each element of the first array to the corresponding element of the second array. This is a vectorized operation. \n",

    "## Dimensions and Shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality, in the context of data, refers to the number of axes or directions in which data can be represented. The most common dimensions are 0, 1, 2, and n.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalars (0-dimensional data; values)** are single numbers. They can be integers, real numbers, or complex numbers. Scalars are the simplest objects in linear algebra.  In Python, we can represent scalars using the built-in `int` and `float` data types. For example, `3` and `3.0` are both scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectors (1-dimensional data, collection of values)** are one-dimensional arrays of scalars. They are used to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. In native Python, we can represent vectors using lists or tuples. For example, `[1, 2, 3]` is a vector.\n",
