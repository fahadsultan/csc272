    "`tqdm` is a Python library that allows you to add a progress bar to your loops. It's very easy to use and can be a great help when you're working with large datasets or when you're running long computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I'll show you how to use `tqdm` with a few examples.\n",

    "```\n",
    "pip install tqdm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `tqdm`, you just need to wrap your iterable with the `tqdm` function. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "from tqdm import tqdm\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in tqdm(range(100)):\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a progress bar that shows the progress of the loop. You can customize the progress bar by passing additional arguments to the `tqdm` function. For example, you can set the total number of iterations, the width of the progress bar, and the format of the progress bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that shows how to customize the progress bar:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tqdm import tqdm\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in tqdm(range(100), total=100, desc=\"Processing\", ncols=100):\n",
    "    # do something\n",
