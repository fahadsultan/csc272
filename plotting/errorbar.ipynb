    "# Error bars \n",
    "\n",
    "Error bars are graphical representations of the variability of data and are used on graphs to indicate the error or uncertainty in a reported measurement. They give a general idea of how precise a measurement is, or conversely, how far from the reported value the true value might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Error Bars\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standard Deviation (SD)**: Represents the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. Error bars using standard deviation show how much the individual data points deviate from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard Error (SE)**: Represents the standard deviation of the sample mean estimate of a population mean. Error bars using standard error indicate the uncertainty around the mean of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence Intervals (CI)**: Represents a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval). Error bars using confidence intervals provide a visual representation of the uncertainty around the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Interpret Error Bars\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the error bars of two groups do not overlap, it suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the error bars overlap, it indicates that there may not be a significant difference between the groups, but this is not definitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The length of the error bars indicates the degree of uncertainty; longer error bars suggest greater variability or less precision in the measurement.\n",
