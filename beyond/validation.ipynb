    "# Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection is a critical step in the machine learning workflow that involves choosing the best model from a set of candidate models based on their performance on a given dataset. The goal is to select a model that generalizes well to unseen data, rather than just performing well on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection generally only applies to supervised learning tasks, where the dataset consists of input-output pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training and Test Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "For effective model validation, the dataset is typically divided into atleast two subsets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Set**: This subset is used to train the model. Training involves feeding the model with input data and corresponding labels so that it can learn patterns and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Set**: This subset is used to assess the final performance of the model after training and validation. It provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's generalization ability. <u>It is extremely important that the test set remains completely unseen during the training to ensure an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.</u>\n",

    "\n",
    "In some cases, a third subset called the **Validation Set** is also used during the training process to tune hyperparameters and make decisions about model architecture. However, in simpler workflows, cross-validation techniques can be employed instead of a separate validation set.\n",

    "## Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of problem (classification, regression, etc.), different metrics are used to evaluate model performance. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error (MSE), R-squared for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common metric for evaluating a classifier is **accuracy**. Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions. It is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Accuracy = \\frac{\\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\\text{Total number of predictions}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a test set of 100 documents, and our classifier correctly predicts the class of 80 of them, then the accuracy is 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is a good metric when the classes are _balanced_ $N_{class1} \\approx N_{class2}$. However, when the classes are imbalanced, accuracy can be misleading. For example, if we have a test set of 100 documents, and 95 of them are positive and 5 of them are negative, then a classifier that always predicts positive will have an accuracy of 95%. However, this classifier is not useful, because it never predicts negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-class classification as multiple Binary classifications**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every multi-class classification problem can be decomposed into multiple binary classification problems. For example, if we have a multi-class classification problem with 3 classes, we can decompose it into 3 binary classification problems.\n",

    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the categorical variable that we are trying to predict is binary, we can define the accuracy in terms of the four possible outcomes of a binary classifier: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. True Positive (TP): The classifier correctly predicted the positive class.\n",
    "2. False Positive (FP): The classifier **incorrectly** predicted the negative class as positive.\n",
    "3. True Negative (TN): The classifier correctly predicted the negative class.\n",
    "4. False Negative (FN):  The classifier **incorrectly** predicted the positive class as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "True positive means that the classifier correctly predicted the positive class. False positive means that the classifier incorrectly predicted the positive class. True negative means that the classifier correctly predicted the negative class. False negative means that the classifier incorrectly predicted the negative class.\n",

    "* **Recall**: The proportion of positive instances that are correctly predicted. Mathematically, it is defined as:\n",

    "$$\\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, precision measures how many of the predicted positive instances are actually positive, while recall measures how many of the actual positive instances are correctly predicted. \n",

    "\n",
    "If the model predicts 10 positive instances, of which 9 are correct (true positives) and 1 is incorrect (false positive), then the precision is 0.9 (9/10) and the recall is 0.09 (9/100).\n",

    "\n",
    "In contrast, a model with <u>poor precision but good recall</u> predicts many more positives than truly exist, catching almost all real positives but generating many false alarms—for instance, predicting 200 positives when only 90 are correct out of 100 actual positives (precision = 0.45, recall = 0.90).\n",

    "\n",
    "* **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{F1-Score} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}$$\n",

    "<!-- $$Baseline\\ Accuracy = \\frac{Number\\ of\\ majority\\ class\\ predictions}{Total\\ number\\ of\\ predictions}$$ -->\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- The baseline accuracy is the accuracy of the majority class classifier. It is the accuracy we would get if we just guessed the majority class for every instance. It is a useful baseline to compare our classifier to. If our classifier is not better than the baseline, then we should probably just use the baseline classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to evaluate a classifier is to look at the confusion matrix. A confusion matrix is a table that shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. For example, if we have a test set of 100 documents, and our classifier correctly predicts the class of 80 of them, then the accuracy is 80%. But if we had just guessed the majority class for all of them, we would have gotten 50% accuracy. This is called the baseline accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Establishing a baseline is an essential step in model validation. A baseline provides a reference point against which the performance of more complex models can be compared. It helps to determine whether a new model is actually improving upon simpler approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sklearn, you can easily implement these baseline models using `DummyClassifier` for classification tasks and `DummyRegressor` for regression tasks to create baseline models.\n",

    "\n",
    "A model that makes random predictions. This is often used to demonstrate that a more sophisticated model performs better than chance. \n",
