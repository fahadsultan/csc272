    "Garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage collection is important because it helps to prevent memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not deallocate it, leading to memory exhaustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage collection is also important because it helps to prevent memory fragmentation. Memory fragmentation occurs when the memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks, leading to inefficient memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of data science and pandas, garbage collection is important because data science projects often involve working with large datasets, which can consume a significant amount of memory. If memory is not properly managed, it can lead to performance issues and crashes.\n",

    "The Python memory manager has different components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The memory allocator: The memory allocator is responsible for allocating memory for objects and data structures.\n",

    "- The garbage collector: The garbage collector is responsible for reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.\n",
    "\n",

    "## How does garbage collection work in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a reference counting mechanism to manage memory. Reference counting is a simple and efficient memory management technique. It works by keeping track of the number of references to an object. When an object is created, its reference count is set to one. When an object is referenced by another object, its reference count is incremented. When an object is no longer referenced, its reference count is decremented. When an object's reference count reaches zero, the object is no longer in use by the program and can be reclaimed by the garbage collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also uses a cyclic garbage collector to handle reference cycles. A reference cycle occurs when two or more objects reference each other in a circular manner. The cyclic garbage collector is responsible for detecting and breaking reference cycles.\n",
