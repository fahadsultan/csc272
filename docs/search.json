For example, when you add objects, if any index pairs are not the same, the respective index in the result will be the union of the index pairs. Let’s look at an example:\n\ns1 = pd.Series([7.3, -2.5, 3.4, 1.5], index=[\"a\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"])\n\ns2 = pd.Series([-2.1, 3.6, -1.5, 4, 3.1], index=[\"a\", \"c\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\"])\n\ns1, s2, s1 + s2\n\n(a    7.3\n c   -2.5\n d    3.4\n e    1.5\n dtype: float64,\n a   -2.1\n c    3.6\n e   -1.5\n f    4.0\n g    3.1\n dtype: float64,\n a    5.2\n c    1.1\n d    NaN\n e    0.0\n f    NaN\n g    NaN\n dtype: float64)\n\n\nThe internal data alignment introduces missing values in the label locations that don’t overlap. Missing values will then propagate in further arithmetic computations.\nIn the case of DataFrame, alignment is performed on both rows and columns:\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame({\"A\": [1, 2], \"B\":[3, 4]})\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame({\"B\": [5, 6], \"D\":[7, 8]})\ndf1 + df2",

    "text": "Creating new columns\nCreating new columns in a DataFrame is a common task when working with data. In this notebook, we will see how to create new columns in a DataFrame based on existing columns or other values.\n\n\n\nNew columns can be created by assigning a value to a new column name.

For example, to create a new column named new_column with the values of the existing column column1, we can use the following code:\n\n\nelections['total_voters'] = ((elections['Popular vote']* 100) / elections['%']).astype(int)\n\nelections.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nCandidate\nParty\nPopular vote\nResult\n%\nconstant\ntotal_voters\n\n\n\n\n0\n1824\nAndrew Jackson\nDemocratic-Republican\n151271\nloss\n57.210122\n10\n264413\n\n\n1\n1824\nJohn Quincy Adams\nDemocratic-Republican\n113142\nwin\n42.789878\n10\n264412\n\n\n2\n1828\nAndrew Jackson\nDemocratic\n642806\nwin\n56.203927\n10\n1143702\n\n\n3\n1828\nJohn Quincy Adams\nNational Republican\n500897\nloss\n43.796073\n10\n1143703\n\n\n4\n1832\nAndrew Jackson\nDemocratic\n702735\nwin\n54.574789\n10\n1287655\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the new column will have the same length as the DataFrame and the calculations are element-wise.

    "text": "Extracting subset of values\nTo extract a subset of values, we can use .loc[] or .iloc[] with row and column indices and labels respectively.\n\n\n\nThe .loc[] method is used to access a group of rows and columns by labels or a boolean array.\n\n.loc[row_labels, col_labels]\nThe .loc operator selects rows and columns in a DataFrame by their row and column label(s), respectively. The row labels (commonly referred to as the indices) are the bold text on the far left of a DataFrame, while the column labels are the column names found at the top of a DataFrame.\n\n\n\nTo grab data with .loc, we must specify the row and column label(s) where the data exists. The row labels are the first argument to the .loc function; the column labels are the second. For example, we can select the the row labeled 0 and the column labeled Candidate from the elections DataFrame.\n\nelections.loc[0, 'Candidate']\n\nTo select multiple rows and columns, we can use Python slice notation. Here, we select the rows from labels 0 to 3 and the columns from labels \"Year\" to \"Popular vote\".\n\nelections.loc[0:3, 'Year':'Popular vote']\n\nSuppose that instead, we wanted every column value for the first four rows in the elections DataFrame. The shorthand : is useful for this.\n\nelections.loc[0:3, :]\n\nThere are a couple of things we should note. Firstly, unlike conventional Python, Pandas allows us to slice string values (in our example, the column labels). Secondly, slicing with .loc is inclusive. Notice how our resulting DataFrame includes every row and column between and including the slice labels we specified.\nEquivalently, we can use a list to obtain multiple rows and columns in our elections DataFrame. elections.loc[[0, 1, 2, 3], [‘Year’, ‘Candidate’, ‘Party’, ‘Popular vote’]]\nLastly, we can interchange list and slicing notation. elections.loc[[0, 1, 2, 3], :]\n\n\n.iloc[row_indices, col_indices]\nThe .iloc[] method is used to access a group of rows and columns by integer position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf you find yourself needing to use .iloc then stop and think if you are about to implement a loop. If so, there is probably a better way to do it.\n\n\nSlicing with .iloc works similarily to .loc, however, .iloc uses the index positions of rows and columns rather the labels (think to yourself: loc uses labels; iloc uses indices). The arguments to the .iloc function also behave similarly -– single values, lists, indices, and any combination of these are permitted.\n\n\n\nLet’s begin reproducing our results from above. We’ll begin by selecting for the first presidential candidate in our elections DataFrame:\n\n# elections.loc[0, \"Candidate\"] - Previous approach\nelections.iloc[0, 1]\n\nNotice how the first argument to both .loc and .iloc are the same. This is because the row with a label of 0 is conveniently in the 0th index (equivalently, the first position) of the elections DataFrame. Generally, this is true of any DataFrame where the row labels are incremented in ascending order from 0.\nHowever, when we select the first four rows and columns using .iloc, we notice something.\n\n# elections.loc[0:3, 'Year':'Popular vote'] - Previous approach\nelections.iloc[0:4, 0:4]\n\nSlicing is no longer inclusive in .iloc -– it’s exclusive. In other words, the right-end of a slice is not included when using .iloc. This is one of the subtleties of pandas syntax; you will get used to it with practice.\n\n#elections.loc[[0, 1, 2, 3], ['Year', 'Candidate', 'Party', 'Popular vote']] - Previous Approach\nelections.iloc[[0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3]]\n\nThis discussion begs the question: when should we use .loc vs .iloc? In most cases, .loc is generally safer to use. You can imagine .iloc may return incorrect values when applied to a dataset where the ordering of data can change.\n\n\n[]\nThe [] selection operator is the most baffling of all, yet the most commonly used. It only takes a single argument, which may be one of the following:\n\nA slice of row numbers\nA list of column labels\nA single column label\n\nThat is, [] is context dependent. Let’s see some examples.\nSay we wanted the first four rows of our elections DataFrame.\n\nelections[0:4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nCandidate\nParty\nPopular vote\nResult\n%\n\n\n\n\n0\n1824\nAndrew Jackson\nDemocratic-Republican\n151271\nloss\n57.210122\n\n\n1\n1824\nJohn Quincy Adams\nDemocratic-Republican\n113142\nwin\n42.789878\n\n\n2\n1828\nAndrew Jackson\nDemocratic\n642806\nwin\n56.203927\n\n\n3\n1828\nJohn Quincy Adams\nNational Republican\n500897\nloss\n43.796073",

In this course, our datasets are typically stored in a CSV (comma-seperated values) file format. We can import a CSV file into a DataFrame by passing the data path as an argument to the following pandas function.  pd.read_csv(\"data/elections.csv\")\n\nThis code stores our DataFrame object in the elections variable. We see that our elections DataFrame has 182 rows and 6 columns (Year, Candidate, Party, Popular Vote, Result, %). Each row represents a single record – in our example, a presedential candidate from some particular year. Each column represents a single attribute, or feature of the record.\nIn the example above, we constructed a DataFrame object using data from a CSV file. As we’ll explore in the next section, we can also create a DataFrame with data of our own.\nIn the elections dataset, each row represents one instance of a candidate running for president in a particular year. For example, the first row represents Andrew Jackson running for president in the year 1824. Each column represents one characteristic piece of information about each presidential candidate. For example, the column named Result stores whether or not the candidate won the election.\nSome relevant arguments for read_csv are:\n\nfilepath_or_buffer: The path to the CSV file.\nsep: The character that separates the values in the CSV file. By default, this is a comma ,.\nheader: The row number to use as the column names. By default, this is 0, which means the first row is used as the column names.\nindex_col: The column to use as the row labels of the DataFrame. By default, this is None, which means that the row labels are integers starting from 0.\nerror_bad_lines: If True, the parser will skip lines with too many fields rather than raising an error. By default, this is False.",

As data scientists, we often wish to investigate trends across a larger subset of our data. For example, we may want to compute some summary statistic (the mean, median, sum, etc.) for a group of rows in our DataFrame. To do this, we’ll use pandas GroupBy objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA groupby operation involves some combination of splitting a DataFrame into grouped subframes, applying a function, and combining the results.\nFor some arbitrary DataFrame df below, the code df.groupby(\"year\").sum() does the following:\n\nSplits the DataFrame into sub-DataFrames with rows belonging to the same year.\nApplies the sum function to each column of each sub-DataFrame.\nCombines the results of sum into a single DataFrame, indexed by year.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say we had baby names for all years in a single DataFrame names\n\nimport urllib.request\nimport os.path\nimport pandas as pd \n\n# Download data from the web directly\ndata_url = \"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip\"\nlocal_filename = \"../data/names.zip\"\nif not os.path.exists(local_filename): # if the data exists don't download again\n    with urllib.request.urlopen(data_url) as resp, open(local_filename, 'wb') as f:\n        f.write(resp.read())\n\n        \n# Load data without unzipping the file\nimport zipfile\nnames = [] \nwith zipfile.ZipFile(local_filename, \"r\") as zf:\n    data_files = [f for f in zf.filelist if f.filename[-3:] == \"txt\"]\n    def extract_year_from_filename(fn):\n        return int(fn[3:7])\n    for f in data_files:\n        year = extract_year_from_filename(f.filename)\n        with zf.open(f) as fp:\n            df = pd.read_csv(fp, names=[\"Name\", \"Sex\", \"Count\"])\n            df[\"Year\"] = year\n            names.append(df)\nnames = pd.concat(names)\n\nnames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nSex\nCount\nYear\n\n\n\n\n0\nMary\nF\n7065\n1880\n\n\n1\nAnna\nF\n2604\n1880\n\n\n2\nEmma\nF\n2003\n1880\n\n\n3\nElizabeth\nF\n1939\n1880\n\n\n4\nMinnie\nF\n1746\n1880\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n31677\nZyell\nM\n5\n2023\n\n\n31678\nZyen\nM\n5\n2023\n\n\n31679\nZymirr\nM\n5\n2023\n\n\n31680\nZyquan\nM\n5\n2023\n\n\n31681\nZyrin\nM\n5\n2023\n\n\n\n\n2117219 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\n\nnames.to_csv(\"../data/names.csv\", index=False)\n\nNow, if we wanted to aggregate all rows in names for a given year, we would need names.groupby(\"Year\")\n\nnames.groupby(\"Year\")\n\n&lt;pandas.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy object at 0x7f7a30b64bb0&gt;\n\n\nWhat does this strange output mean? Calling .groupby has generated a GroupBy object. You can imagine this as a set of “mini” sub-DataFrames, where each subframe contains all of the rows from names that correspond to a particular year.\nThe diagram below shows a simplified view of names to help illustrate this idea.\n\n\n\nWe can’t work with a GroupBy object directly – that is why you saw that strange output earlier, rather than a standard view of a DataFrame. To actually manipulate values within these “mini” DataFrames, we’ll need to call an aggregation method. This is a method that tells pandas how to aggregate the values within the GroupBy object. Once the aggregation is applied, pandas will return a normal (now grouped) DataFrame.\nAggregation functions (.min(), .max(), .mean(), .sum(), etc.) are the most common way to work with GroupBy objects. These functions are applied to each column of a “mini” grouped DataFrame. We end up with a new DataFrame with one aggregated row per subframe. Let’s see this in action by finding the sum of all counts for each year in names – this is equivalent to finding the number of babies born in each year.\n\nnames.groupby(\"Year\").sum().head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount\n\n\nYear\n\n\n\n\n\n1880\n201484\n\n\n1881\n192690\n\n\n1882\n221533\n\n\n1883\n216944\n\n\n1884\n243461\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can relate this back to the diagram we used above. Remember that the diagram uses a simplified version of names, which is why we see smaller values for the summed counts.\n\n\n\n\nCalling .agg has condensed each subframe back into a single row. This gives us our final output: a DataFrame that is now indexed by \"Year\", with a single row for each unique year in the original names DataFrame.\nYou may be wondering: where did the \"State\", \"Sex\", and \"Name\" columns go? Logically, it doesn’t make sense to sum the string data in these columns (how would we add “Mary” + “Ann”?). Because of this, pandas will simply omit these columns when it performs the aggregation on the DataFrame. Since this happens implicitly, without the user specifying that these columns should be ignored, it’s easy to run into troubling situations where columns are removed without the programmer noticing. It is better coding practice to select only the columns we care about before performing the aggregation.\n\n# Same result, but now we explicitly tell pandas to only consider the \"Count\" column when summing\nnames.groupby(\"Year\")[[\"Count\"]].sum().head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount\n\n\nYear\n\n\n\n\n\n1880\n201484\n\n\n1881\n192690\n\n\n1882\n221533\n\n\n1883\n216944\n\n\n1884\n243461\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many different aggregations that can be applied to the grouped data. The primary requirement is that an aggregation function must:\n\nTake in a Series of data (a single column of the grouped subframe)\nReturn a single value that aggregates this Series\n\nBecause of this fairly broad requirement, pandas offers many ways of computing an aggregation.\nIn-built Python operations – such as sum, max, and min – are automatically recognized by pandas.\n\n# What is the maximum count for each name in any year?\nnames.groupby(\"Name\")[[\"Count\"]].max().head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\nAaban\n16\n\n\nAabha\n9\n\n\nAabid\n6\n\n\nAabidah\n5\n\n\nAabir\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# What is the minimum count for each name in any year?\nnames.groupby(\"Name\")[[\"Count\"]].min().head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\nAaban\n5\n\n\nAabha\n5\n\n\nAabid\n5\n\n\nAabidah\n5\n\n\nAabir\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# What is the average count for each name across all years?\nnames.groupby(\"Name\")[[\"Count\"]].mean().head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\nAaban\n10.000000\n\n\nAabha\n6.375000\n\n\nAabid\n5.333333\n\n\nAabidah\n5.000000\n\n\nAabir\n5.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npandas also offers a number of in-built functions for aggregation. Some examples include:\n\n.sum()\n.max()\n.min()\n.mean()\n.first()\n.last()\n\nThe latter two entries in this list – \"first\" and \"last\" – are unique to pandas. They return the first or last entry in a subframe column. Why might this be useful? Consider a case where multiple columns in a group share identical information. To represent this information in the grouped output, we can simply grab the first or last entry, which we know will be identical to all other entries.\nLet’s illustrate this with an example. Say we add a new column to names that contains the first letter of each name.\n\n# Imagine we had an additional column, \"First Letter\". We'll explain this code next week\nnames[\"First Letter\"] = names[\"Name\"].apply(lambda x: x[0])\n\n# We construct a simplified DataFrame containing just a subset of columns\nnames_new = names[[\"Name\", \"First Letter\", \"Year\"]]\nnames_new.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nFirst Letter\nYear\n\n\n\n\n0\nMary\nM\n1880\n\n\n1\nAnna\nA\n1880\n\n\n2\nEmma\nE\n1880\n\n\n3\nElizabeth\nE\n1880\n\n\n4\nMinnie\nM\n1880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we form groups for each name in the dataset, \"First Letter\" will be the same for all members of the group. This means that if we simply select the first entry for \"First Letter\" in the group, we’ll represent all data in that group.\nWe can use a dictionary to apply different aggregation functions to each column during grouping.\n\n\n\n\n\nnames_new.groupby(\"Name\").agg({\"First Letter\":\"first\", \"Year\":\"max\"}).head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Letter\nYear\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaban\nA\n2019\n\n\nAabha\nA\n2021\n\n\nAabid\nA\n2018\n\n\nAabidah\nA\n2018\n\n\nAabir\nA\n2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also define aggregation functions of our own! This can be done using either a def or lambda statement. Again, the condition for a custom aggregation function is that it must take in a Series and output a single scalar value.\n\ndef ratio_to_peak(series):\n    return series.iloc[-1]/max(series)\n\nnames.groupby(\"Name\")[[\"Year\", \"Count\"]].apply(ratio_to_peak)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nInput In [2], in &lt;cell line: 4&gt;()\n      1 def ratio_to_peak(series):\n      2     return series.iloc[-1]/max(series)\n----&gt; 4 names.groupby(\"Name\")[[\"Year\", \"Count\"]].apply(ratio_to_peak)\n\nNameError: name 'names' is not defined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nlambda functions are a special type of function that can be defined in a single line.

The input parameter x to the lambda function is a GroupBy object. Therefore, it should make sense why lambda x : x.iloc[0] selects the first row in each groupby object.\nIn fact, there’s a few different ways to approach this problem. Each approach has different tradeoffs in terms of readability, performance, memory consumption, complexity, etc. We’ve given a few examples below.\nNote: Understanding these alternative solutions is not required.

Some useful options are:\n\n.mean: creates a new DataFrame with the mean value of each group\n.sum: creates a new DataFrame with the sum of each group\n.max and .min: creates a new DataFrame with the maximum/minimum value of each group\n.first and .last: creates a new DataFrame with the first/last row in each group\n.size: creates a new Series with the number of entries in each group\n.count: creates a new DataFrame with the number of entries, excluding missing values.\n\nNote the slight difference between .size() and .count(): while .size() returns a Series and counts the number of entries including the missing values, .count() returns a DataFrame and counts the number of entries in each column excluding missing values. Here’s an example:\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'letter':['A','A','B','C','C','C'], \n                   'num':[1,2,3,4,None,4], \n                   'state':[None, 'tx', 'fl', 'hi', None, 'ak']})\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nletter\nnum\nstate\n\n\n\n\n0\nA\n1.0\nNone\n\n\n1\nA\n2.0\ntx\n\n\n2\nB\n3.0\nfl\n\n\n3\nC\n4.0\nhi\n\n\n4\nC\nNaN\nNone\n\n\n5\nC\n4.0\nak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.groupby(\"letter\").size()\n\nletter\nA    2\nB    1\nC    3\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\ndf.groupby(\"letter\").count()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnum\nstate\n\n\nletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n2\n1\n\n\nB\n1\n1\n\n\nC\n2\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might recall that the value_counts() function in the previous note does something similar. It turns out value_counts() and groupby.size() are the same, except value_counts() sorts the resulting Series in descending order automatically.\n\ndf[\"letter\"].value_counts()\n\nC    3\nA    2\nB    1\nName: letter, dtype: int64\n\n\nhese (and other) aggregation functions are so common that pandas allows for writing shorthand. Instead of explicitly stating the use of .agg, we can call the function directly on the GroupBy object.\nFor example, the following are equivalent:\n\nelections.groupby(\"Candidate\").agg(mean)\nelections.groupby(\"Candidate\").mean()\n\nThere are many other methods that pandas supports. You can check them out on the pandas documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering by Group\nAnother common use for GroupBy objects is to filter data by group.\ngroupby.filter takes an argument \\(\\text{f}\\), where \\(\\text{f}\\) is a function that:\n\nTakes a DataFrame object as input\nReturns a single True or False for the each sub-DataFrame\n\nSub-DataFrames that correspond to True are returned in the final result, whereas those with a False value are not. Importantly, groupby.filter is different from groupby.agg in that an entire sub-DataFrame is returned in the final DataFrame, not just a single row. As a result, groupby.filter preserves the original indices.\nTo illustrate how this happens, consider the following .filter function applied on some arbitrary data. Say we want to identify “tight” election years – that is, we want to find all rows that correspond to elections years where all candidates in that year won a similar portion of the total vote. Specifically, let’s find all rows corresponding to a year where no candidate won more than 45% of the total vote.\nIn other words, we want to:\n\nFind the years where the maximum % in that year is less than 45%\nReturn all DataFrame rows that correspond to these years\n\nFor each year, we need to find the maximum % among all rows for that year. If this maximum % is lower than 45%, we will tell pandas to keep all rows corresponding to that year.\n\nelections.groupby(\"Year\").filter(lambda sf: sf[\"%\"].max() &lt; 45).head(9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nCandidate\nParty\nPopular vote\nResult\n%\n\n\n\n\n23\n1860\nAbraham Lincoln\nRepublican\n1855993\nwin\n39.699408\n\n\n24\n1860\nJohn Bell\nConstitutional Union\n590901\nloss\n12.639283\n\n\n25\n1860\nJohn C.

In this example, we’ve defined our filtering function, \\(\\text{f}\\), to be lambda sf: sf[\"%\"].max() &lt; 45. This filtering function will find the maximum \"%\" value among all entries in the grouped sub-DataFrame, which we call sf. If the maximum value is less than 45, then the filter function will return True and all rows in that grouped sub-DataFrame will appear in the final output DataFrame.\nExamine the DataFrame above. Notice how, in this preview of the first 9 rows, all entries from the years 1860 and 1912 appear. This means that in 1860 and 1912, no candidate in that year won more than 45% of the total vote.\nYou may ask: how is the groupby.filter procedure different to the boolean filtering we’ve seen previously? Boolean filtering considers individual rows when applying a boolean condition. For example, the code elections[elections[\"%\"] &lt; 45] will check the \"%\" value of every single row in elections; if it is less than 45, then that row will be kept in the output. groupby.filter, in contrast, applies a boolean condition across all rows in a group. If not all rows in that group satisfy the condition specified by the filter, the entire group will be discarded in the output.",

    "text": "Aggregation with .pivot_table\nWe know now that .groupby gives us the ability to group and aggregate data across our DataFrame. The examples above formed groups using just one column in the DataFrame. It’s possible to group by multiple columns at once by passing in a list of column names to .groupby.\nLet’s consider the names dataset. In this problem, we will find the total number of baby names associated with each sex for each year. To do this, we’ll group by both the \"Year\" and \"Sex\" columns.\n\nnames.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nSex\nCount\nYear\nFirst Letter\n\n\n\n\n0\nMary\nF\n7065\n1880\nM\n\n\n1\nAnna\nF\n2604\n1880\nA\n\n\n2\nEmma\nF\n2003\n1880\nE\n\n\n3\nElizabeth\nF\n1939\n1880\nE\n\n\n4\nMinnie\nF\n1746\n1880\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Find the total number of baby names associated with each sex for each year in the data\nnames.groupby([\"Year\", \"Sex\"])[[\"Count\"]].sum().head(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount\n\n\nYear\nSex\n\n\n\n\n\n1880\nF\n90994\n\n\nM\n110490\n\n\n1881\nF\n91953\n\n\nM\n100737\n\n\n1882\nF\n107847\n\n\nM\n113686\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that both \"Year\" and \"Sex\" serve as the index of the DataFrame (they are both rendered in bold). We’ve created a multi-index DataFrame where two different index values, the year and sex, are used to uniquely identify each row.\nThis isn’t the most intuitive way of representing this data – and, because multi-indexed DataFrames have multiple dimensions in their index, they can often be difficult to use.\nAnother strategy to aggregate across two columns is to create a pivot table. One set of values is used to create the index of the pivot table; another set is used to define the column names. The values contained in each cell of the table correspond to the aggregated data for each index-column pair.\nThe best way to understand pivot tables is to see one in action. Let’s return to our original goal of summing the total number of names associated with each combination of year and sex. We’ll call the pandas .pivot_table method to create a new table.\n\n# The `pivot_table` method is used to generate a Pandas pivot table\nnames.pivot_table(\n    index = \"Year\", \n    columns = \"Sex\", \n    values = \"Count\", \n    aggfunc = sum).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex\nF\nM\n\n\nYear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1880\n90994\n110490\n\n\n1881\n91953\n100737\n\n\n1882\n107847\n113686\n\n\n1883\n112319\n104625\n\n\n1884\n129019\n114442\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks a lot better! Now, our DataFrame is structured with clear index-column combinations. Each entry in the pivot table represents the summed count of names for a given combination of \"Year\" and \"Sex\".\nLet’s take a closer look at the code implemented above.\n\nindex = \"Year\" specifies the column name in the original DataFrame that should be used as the index of the pivot table\ncolumns = \"Sex\" specifies the column name in the original DataFrame that should be used to generate the columns of the pivot table\nvalues = \"Count\" indicates what values from the original DataFrame should be used to populate the entry for each index-column combination\naggfunc = sum tells pandas what function to use when aggregating the data specified by values. Here, we are summing the name counts for each pair of \"Year\" and \"Sex\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can even include multiple values in the index or columns of our pivot tables.\n\nnames_pivot = names.pivot_table(\n    index=\"Year\",     # the rows (turned into index)\n    columns=\"Sex\",    # the column values\n    values=[\"Count\", \"Name\"], \n    aggfunc=max,   # group operation\n)\nnames_pivot.head(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount\nName\n\n\nSex\nF\nM\nF\nM\n\n\nYear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1880\n7065\n9655\nZula\nZeke\n\n\n1881\n6919\n8769\nZula\nZeb\n\n\n1882\n8148\n9557\nZula\nZed\n\n\n1883\n8012\n8894\nZula\nZeno\n\n\n1884\n9217\n9388\nZula\nZollie\n\n\n1885\n9128\n8756\nZula\nZollie",

    "text": "VECTORIZED OPERATIONS\nVector based programming (also known as array based programming) is a programming paradigm that uses operations on arrays to execute tasks. This is in contrast to scalar based programming where operations are performed on individual elements of an array.\n\n \n\nVectorization operates at the level of individual instructions sent to a processor within each node. For instance, in the illustration shown here, the instruction is to add 5 to a column of numbers and copy the results to a new column B. With vectorization, all the data elements in that column are transformed simultaneously, i.e. the instruction to add 5 is applied to multiple pieces of data at the same time. This paradigm is sometimes referred to as Single Instruction Multiple Data (or SIMD).\nWe can think of vectorization as subdividing the work into smaller chunks that can be handled independently by different computational units at the same time.\nThis is orders of magnitude faster than the conventional sequential model where each piece of data is handled one after the other in sequence.\nWith vectorization, performing the same operation on a modern intel CPU is 16 times faster than the sequential mode. The performance gains on GPUs with thousands of computational cores is even greater. However, despite these remarkable performance benefits, most analytical code out there is written in the slower sequential mode. This is not a surprise, since until about a decade ago, CPU and GPU hardware could not really support vectorization for data analysis. So most implementations had to be sequential.\nThe last 10 years, however, have seen the rise of new technologies like CUDA from NVidia and advanced vector extensions from Intel that have dramatically shifted our ability to apply vectorization. Because of the power of vectorization, some traditional vendors now make claims about including vectorization in their offerings. But shifting to this new vectorized paradigm is not easy, since all of your code needs to be written from scratch to utilize these capabilities. Unlike Kinetica, these traditional databases incorporate only partial vectorization, limited to specific operations such as filters or some aggregations and continue to use outdated and less performant modes of computation for other analytical tasks. These solutions also only leverage vectorization on the CPUs.",

    "text": "Tabular (2-dimensional) Data\nTables are one of the most common ways to organize data. This is in large part due to the simplicity and flexibility of tables. Tables allow us to represent each observation, or instance of collecting data from an individual, as its own row. We can record distinct characteristics, or features, of each observation in separate columns.\n\n\n\n\nTo see this in action, we’ll explore the elections dataset, which stores information about political candidates who ran for president of the United States in various years.\nThe first few rows of elections dataset in CSV format are as follows:\nmombka csv Year,Candidate,Party,Popular vote,Result,%\\n 1824,Andrew Jackson,Democratic-Republican,151271,loss,57.21012204\\n 1824,John Quincy Adams,Democratic-Republican,113142,win,42.78987796\\n 1828,Andrew Jackson,Democratic,642806,win,56.20392707\\n 1828,John Quincy Adams,National Republican,500897,loss,43.79607293\\n 1832,Andrew Jackson,Democratic,702735,win,54.57478905\\n\nThis dataset is stored in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format. CSV files due to their simplicity and readability are one of the most common ways to store tabular data. Each line in a CSV file (file extension: .csv) represents a row in the table. In other words, each row is separated by a newline character \\n. Within each row, each column is separated by a comma ,, hence the name Comma Separated Values.",

During this time, I was part of the team that built TapFish, the top-grossing game worldwide, for two weeks in 2011, on both the App Store and Google Play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo games development\n\n\n\nUrban Sensing\n\n\n\nComputational Neuroscience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI then went on to work at Technology for People Initiative, an applied research lab in my where I mined social media and cell phone data for proxies of socio-economic indicators that allowed more inclusive policy-making for marginalized communities. During these years, I also dabbled in data journalism and helped organize a boot camp on using data for journalists with the support of the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) and the Knight Foundation.\n\nIn 2015, I moved to Mecca, Saudi Arabia to work for the GIS Innovation Center (now Wadi Makkah). There I worked on innovative urban sensing techniques for better crowd control during the annual pilgrimage to the city, the largest human gathering in the world every year.\nDuring my PhD, I worked at the intersection of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics and machine learning. My work focused on identifying neurological and genetic biomarkers linking type-2 diabetes with cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s and other dementias.\nI live in Travelers Rest with my wife and cat.\n\n\nOffice: Riley Hall 200-D\nEmail: fahad.sultan@furman.edu\nMy office hours this semester are 10 - 11:30 AM on Mondays and Wednesdays.\nI have an Open door policy.

I will also upload all of your grades there.\n\n\n\nDeclarative knowledge is knowledge about facts. It is knowledge that answers the “What is” questions. Most courses outside Computer Science are about declarative knowledge.\nIn contrast, Imperative knowledge is knowledge about how to do things. It is knowledge that answers the “How to” questions.\nWhile we will spend a non-trivial amount of time in this course on declarative knowledge, the overwhelming majority of this course will focus on imperative knowledge. Your grade in this course will be determined by your ability to apply declarative and more importantly imperative knowledge to solve problems.\n\nResearch shows that there is only one way to acquire imperative knowledge: Practice, Practice, Practice !. Practice combined with feedback is the only way to achieve mastery.\nIn this course, you will be given ample opportunities to practice along with regular feedback.\n\n\n\nApproach assignments purely as opportunities to learn, prepare for exams and to prepare for your career.\n\nIt is not worth cheating on assignments. Just come talk to me if you are struggling with an assignment. I will literally just tell you the answer.\nOn assignments, expect near maximal flexibility from me. Every assignment will be due 10 days calendar after it is posted.\nYou can schedule a time to get your assignments graded using this link.\nWritten Assignments:\nWritten assignments are to help you build a deeper understanding of algorithms and math covered in class.\nThese could simply be math problems or involve tracing algorithms and dry-runs.\nBoth handwritten or typed submissions are acceptable. Submissions, as always, on Moodle.\nProgramming Assignments:\nProgramming assignments are going to be posted at the start of the lab session each week and will be due in 10 days, unless otherwise specified.\nAll Programming assignments will be graded through an in-person code review. You are to give a walkthrough of your code and be able to answer questions about it.\nDuring these code review, you will be given feedback on how to improve your code and avoid common mistakes.\nYou should expect questions in the exams similar to assignments.\n\n\n\nI have created 10 graded items under class participation on Moodle.

Any and all feedback is welcome!\nI have created an anonymous feedback poll on Moodle. Please use this to anonymously share any feedback.\nShare any changes you want me to make in the course, at any point in the semester. You can submit multiple times over the span of the semester.\nThink of it as a Complaints Box for the course.\n\n\n\n\n“Data Mining” is a term from the 1990s, back when it was an exciting and popular new field. Around 2010, people instead started to speak of “big data”. Today, the popular term is “data science”. There are some who even regard data mining as synonymous with machine learning. There is no question that some data mining appropriately uses algorithms from machine learning. However, during all this time, the concept remained the same: use the most powerful hardware, the most powerful programming systems, and the most efficient algorithms to solve problems in science, commerce, healthcare, government, the humanities, and many other fields of human endeavor.\n\n\n\nFrom the Venn Diagram, the course content is going to cover ✅ Hacking Skills and ✅ Math & Statistics in detail but not ☐ Substantive Expertise. For that missing piece, I strongly encourage you to bring in knowledge from your GERs and other Non-CS department courses into this class and the term project in particular. Nothing would make me happier than to see projects that combines CS with your other interests.\n\n\n\n“But wait, I am not a Math Person!” you say!\nThere is no such thing as a “Math Person”. I do recognize, however, that Math Anxiety is a real thing and is very common. It is a feeling of fear based on a belief that one is not good at math or that math is inherently difficult.\nPlease use this course as an opportunity to overcome your Math anxiety!\nIn this course, the code you write will be mostly math. Most modern “AI” is just that: math, in code.\nThis presents a unique opportunity for you to overcome your Math anxiety. You will be able to see the math in action, be able to visualize the results and have a conversation with it.\nTrust me, there is a tremendous amount of beauty and joy to be found in mathematics. And if beauty and joy aren’t really your thing, then let me also assure you there is a lot of money to be made these days by being good at coding math. Either way, the rewards are well worth the effort!",

In particular, please make sure to read the Grading, Academic Integrity and Textbook and other Resources sections carefully.\nAll of the course content will be posted on this website.\nImportant announcements will be made on both the course website homepage and in class.\nYou are to submit assignments and exams on the course Moodle page. I will also upload all of your grades there.\n\n\n\nDeclarative knowledge is knowledge about facts. It is knowledge that answers the “What is” questions. Most courses outside Computer Science are about declarative knowledge.\nIn contrast, Imperative knowledge is knowledge about how to do things. It is knowledge that answers the “How to” questions.\nWhile we will spend a non-trivial amount of time in this course on declarative knowledge, the overwhelming majority of this course will focus on imperative knowledge. Your grade in this course will be determined by your ability to apply declarative and more importantly imperative knowledge to solve problems.\n\nResearch shows that there is only one way to acquire imperative knowledge: Practice, Practice, Practice !. Practice combined with feedback is the only way to achieve mastery.\nIn this course, you will be given ample opportunities to practice along with regular feedback.\n\n\n\nApproach assignments purely as opportunities to learn, prepare for exams and to prepare for your career.\n\nIt is not worth cheating on assignments. Just come talk to me if you are struggling with an assignment. I will literally just tell you the answer.\nOn assignments, expect near maximal flexibility from me. Every assignment will be due 10 days calendar after it is posted.\nYou can schedule a time to get your assignments graded using this link.\nWritten Assignments:\nWritten assignments are to help you build a deeper understanding of algorithms and math covered in class.\nThese could simply be math problems or involve tracing algorithms and dry-runs.\nBoth handwritten or typed submissions are acceptable. Submissions, as always, on Moodle.\nProgramming Assignments:\nProgramming assignments are going to be posted at the start of the lab session each week and will be due in 10 days, unless otherwise specified.\nAll Programming assignments will be graded through an in-person code review. You are to give a walkthrough of your code and be able to answer questions about it.\nDuring these code review, you will be given feedback on how to improve your code and avoid common mistakes.\nYou should expect questions in the exams similar to assignments.\n\n\n\nI have created 10 graded items under class participation on Moodle. In class, you will be asked to answer a question or solve a problem. You will be graded on the basis of your participation. It is your responsibility to make sure you have 10 points by the end of the semester.\nThere are 10 graded items under class participation on Moodle. In class, you will be asked to answer a question or solve a problem. You will be graded on the basis of your participation. It is your responsibility to make sure you have 10 points by the end of the semester.\n\\[\\frac{24~\\text{students} \\times 10~\\text{points needed by each student}}{15~\\text{weeks} \\times 2~\\text{classes per week}} = 8~\\text{points given out class, on average}\\]\nI will give out class participation points in every class class for answering or asking a question.\nGiven the glut of information accessible online and otherwise in this day and age, meaningful interactions with your peers and teachers is essentially why you are paying your college tuition.\nPlease come to class, labs and office hours\nPlease ask questions during class\nPlease answer questions and participate in discussions during class\n\n\n\nThere will be three exams in the course, including the final. The final exam will be cumulative. Exams constitute 60% of your course grade.\nAll exams will be on computer, with a large programming component. Questions will be posted on Moodle and you will have to submit your solutions on Moodle, just like assignments.\nYou will be evaluated on your ability to apply knowledge to new problems and not just on your ability to retain and recall information.\nThe exams, more than the assignments, are going to determine your grade.\nAll exams are going to be cumulative, with focus on the topics covered since last exam.\nDiligent work on the homework and assignments will be rewarded here.\n\n\n\nEverything is tentative and subject to change\n\nThis is my first teaching this course. Any and all feedback is welcome!\nI have created an anonymous feedback poll on Moodle. Please use this to anonymously share any feedback.\nShare any changes you want me to make in the course, at any point in the semester. You can submit multiple times over the span of the semester.\nThink of it as a Complaints Box for the course.",

    "text": "The course is called Data Structures & Algorithms. In my opinion, a more appropriate name for the course would have been Complexities, Abstractions and Scalability.\nComplexity is the primary challenge we will be dealing with in this course. Abstractions are going to be our primary tool to deal with complexity. Scalability is the primary goal in this course i.e. to write code that can handle the data we have today and the data we expect to have in the future.\n\nIn the world of software development, lines of code (LOC) are often used as a metric to measure the size and complexity of a codebase. The more lines of code a project has, the larger and more intricate it is likely to be.\nHow many millions of lines of code does it take to make the modern program, web service, car, or airplane possible? The figure below sheds some light on this question.\n\n\n\nThe range is extraordinary: the average iPhone app has less than 50,000 lines of code, while Google’s entire code base is two billion lines for all services. The code needed for fighter jets, popular video game engines, and even the Large Hadron Collider falls somewhere in between the two. It’s been said that the modern smartphone has more lines of code than a passenger jet – and that the code for a typical car has 100 million lines of code.\nIn fact, the lines of code for the Apollo 11 moon lander totaled just 145,000 – and the code for the Space Shuttle was about the same.\nIt’s more than what was needed to run old technologies like the Space Shuttle, a pacemaker, or even the game engine of Quake 3 – but it’s not enough to be the driving force behind the modern software that’s used in everyday life today.\n\nA million lines of code, if printed, would be about 18,000 pages of text. That’s 14x the length of War and Peace.\nHow do we then manage this complexity? A large part of the answer lies in Abstractions. Abstractions are ways of dividing a complex system into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each piece is a black box or module that can be used without having to know how it works internally. However, the pieces are not completely opaque. They have a well-defined interface that allows us to use them without knowing how they work internally.\nOn the other hand, the amount of Data that we have to deal with is growing exponentially. Approximately 328.77 million terabytes of data are created each day.\n\nHere’s a selection of other user-generated internet content stats:\n\n\n\nType of Media\nAmount per Minute\nAmount per Day\n\n\n\n\nEmails sent\n231.4 million\n333.22 billion\n\n\nTexts sent\n16 million\n24.04 billion\n\n\nGoogle searches\n5.9 million\n8.5 billion\n\n\nSnaps shared on Snapchat\n2.43 million\n3.5 billion\n\n\nPieces of content shared on Facebook\n1.7 million\n2.45 billion\n\n\nSwipes on Tinder\n1.1 million\n1.58 billion\n\n\nHours streamed\n1 million\n1.44 billion\n\n\nUSD spent on Amazon\n443,000\n637.92 million\n\n\nUSD sent on Venmo\n437,600\n630.14 million\n\n\nTweets shared on Twitter\n347,200\n499.97 million\n\n\nHours spent in Zoom meetings\n104,600\n150.62 million\n\n\nUSD spent on DoorDash\n76,400\n110.02 million\n\n\n\nFor the software engineer this means writing code that can not only handle the data we have today, but also data that we expect to have in the future. In other words, we need to write code that is scalable.",

    "text": "A LOT of problems in computer science can be ‘reduced’ to a very small set of fundamental problems.\nIn this course, we are going to focus on the six of such fundamental problems.\n\nSearch : Given a set of data, find a particular element in the set\nSort : Given a set of data, arrange the elements in a particular order\n\n3-6. Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)\n\n\nWe are concerned with the process of collecting information in a computer’s memory, in such a way that the information can subsequently be recovered as quickly as possible.\n\nIn this course, we are going to focus on the simplest form of search: searching for a single element in a set of data i.e.  how to find the data that has been stored with a given identification. For example, in a numerical application we might want to find \\(f(x)\\), given \\(x\\) and a table of the values of \\(f\\); in a nonnumerical application, we might want to find the English translation of a given Russian word.\nIn general, we shall suppose that a set of \\(N\\) records has been stored, and the problem is to locate the appropriate one. As in the case of sorting, we assume that each record includes a special field called its key; this terminology is especially appropriate, because many people spend a great deal of time every day searching for their keys. We generally require the \\(N\\) keys to be distinct, so that each key uniquely identifies its record. Algorithms for searching are presented with a so-called argument, \\(q\\), and the problem is to find which record has \\(q\\) as its key.\nAfter the search is complete, two possibilities can arise:\n\nEither the search was successful, having located the unique record containing \\(q\\); or\nIt was unsuccessful, having determined that \\(q\\) is nowhere to be found.\n\nFormally, the search problem is defined as follows:\n\nProblem: \\(\\textbf{Search}\\)\nInput: A set of \\(n\\) keys \\(S\\), and a query key \\(q\\).\nRequired Output: The location of \\(q\\) in \\(S\\), if present, else \\(-1\\).\n\nSearching is the most time-consuming part of many programs, and the substitution of a good search method for a bad one often leads to a substantial increase in speed. In fact we can often arrange the data or the data structure so that searching is eliminated entirely, by ensuring that we always know just where to find the information we need.\nEfficient algorithms for searching turn out to be quite important in practice.\n\n\n\nTypical computer science students study the basic sorting algorithms at least three times before they graduate: first in introductory programming, then in data structures, and finally in an advanced algorithms course.\n\nWhy is sorting worth so much attention? There are several reasons:\n\nSorting is the basic building block that many other algorithms are built around. By understanding sorting, we obtain an amazing amount of power to solve other problems.\nMost of the interesting ideas used in the design of algorithms appear in the context of sorting, such as divide-and-conquer, data structures, and randomized algorithms.\nComputers have historically spent more time sorting than doing anything else. Research shows that a quarter of all computer cycles were spent sorting data [Knu98]. Sorting remains the most ubiquitous combinatorial algorithm problem in practice.\nSorting is the most thoroughly studied problem in computer science. Literally dozens of different algorithms are known, most of which possess some particular advantage over all other algorithms in certain situations.\n\nFormally, the sorting problem is defined as follows:\n\nProblem: \\(\\textbf{Sorting}\\)\nInput: A sequence of \\(n\\) numbers \\(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n\\).\nRequired Output: A permutation (reordering) \\(a_1', a_2', \\dots, a_n'\\) of the input sequence such that \\(a_1' \\leq a_2' \\leq \\dots \\leq a_n'\\).\n\nIn this course, we will discuss sorting in reasonable detail, stressing how sorting can be applied to solving other problems. We will also also sorting as a way to introduce paradigms of algorithm design and analysis.\n\n\n\nCreate: Adding a record to a database, inserting a node into a linked list, and inserting an element into a priority queue are all examples of the insert problem. Other names of this problem include: Insert, Add, Post\n\nRead: Reading or accessing data is the most fundamental problem in computer science. Other names of this problem include: Access, Get, Fetch, Retrieve\nUpdate: For each of the following problems, we are given a set of N records, each record containing a key and some associated data, and we are given a particular key K. The problem is to modify the record containing K in some way. Other names of this problem include: Modify, Edit, Patch\nDelete: Deleting a record from a database, deleting a node from a linked list, and deleting an element from a priority queue are all examples of the delete problem. Other names of this problem include: Remove, Drop",

Trees are used to represent the hierarchical relationships between data elements.\nExamples of applications of trees in computer science include the representation of file systems and the structure of many data formats such as JSON, XML and HTML.\n\n   \n\nGraphs are used to represent relationships between data elements that are not hierarchical.\nExamples of applications of graphs in computer science include the representation of social networks, the representation of the internet, and the representation of the structure of a computer network.",

    "text": "“Data Mining” is a term from the 1990s, back when it was an exciting and popular new field. Around 2010, people instead started to speak of “big data”. Today, the popular term is “data science”. There are some who even regard data mining as synonymous with machine learning. There is no question that some data mining appropriately uses algorithms from machine learning. However, during all this time, the concept remained the same: use the most powerful hardware, the most powerful programming systems, and the most efficient algorithms to solve problems in science, commerce, healthcare, government, the humanities, and many other fields of human endeavor.\n\n\n\nFrom the Venn Diagram, the course content is going to cover ✅ Hacking Skills and ✅ Math & Statistics in detail but not ☐ Substantive Expertise. For that missing piece, I strongly encourage you to bring in knowledge from your GERs and other Non-CS department courses into this class and the term project in particular. Nothing would make me happier than to see projects that combines CS with your other interests.",

    "section": "1. Ask a Question and Obtain Data",
    "text": "1. Ask a Question and Obtain Data\n **Due before Exam 1**\nWhether by curiosity or necessity, data scientists will constantly ask questions. For example, in the business world, data scientists may be interested in predicting the profit generated by a certain investment. In the field of medicine, they may ask whether some patients are more likely than others to benefit from a treatment.\nPosing questions is one of the primary ways the data science lifecycle begins. It helps to fully define the question. Here are some things you should ask yourself before framing a question.\n\nWhat do we want to know?\n\nA question that is too ambiguous may lead to confusion.\n\nWhat problems are we trying to solve?\n\nThe goal of asking a question should be clear in order to justify your efforts to stakeholders.\n\nWhat are the hypotheses we want to test?\n\nThis gives a clear perspective from which to analyze final results.\n\nWhat are the metrics for our success?\n\nThis gives a clear point to know when to finish the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| 1. Ask a Question | 2. Obtain Data |\nThe second entry point to the lifecycle is by obtaining data. A careful analysis of any problem requires the use of data. Data may be readily available to us, or we may have to embark on a process to collect it. When doing so, its crucial to ask the following:\n\nWhat data do we have and what data do we need?\n\nDefine the units of the data (people, cities, points in time, etc.) and what features to measure.\n\nHow will we sample more data?\n\nScrape the web, collect manually, etc.\n\nIs our data representative of the population we want to study?\n\nIf our data is not representative of our population of interest, then we can come to incorrect conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Phase 1\n\n\n\nIdentify or collect a publicly available data set that you will use for your project. A list of possible datasets and project ideas are provided here but you are allowed to propose your own project and data set. Just be mindful of the scale of the data: it should be large enough to be appropriate for usage in Machine Learning, but not so large that it is unwieldy.\nKey procedures: Data Acquisition, Data Cleaning"

It’s impossible to discern all the patterns and relationships between variables without carefully investigating them. Therefore, translating pure data to actionable insights is a key job of a data scientist. For example, we may choose to ask:\n\nHow is our data organized and what does it contain?\n\nKnowing what the data says about the world helps us better understand the world.\n\nDo we have relevant data?\n\nIf the data we have collected is not useful to the question at hand, then we must collected more data.\n\nWhat are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?\n\nThese can lead to many false conclusions if ignored, so data scientists must always be aware of these issues.\n\nHow do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?\n\nData is not always easy to interpret at first glance, so a data scientist should reveal these hidden insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Phase 2\n\n\n\nPerform some exploratory analysis to help you get acquainted with the data. This may include data visualization and basic preliminary analysis. Identify interesting aspects of the data set that would be useful for downstream prediction: correlations, outliers, missing values, etc.\nKey procedures: Exploratory data analysis, Data visualization."
